# Instructions

- You will be given some question and the correct answer. Your job is to generate diverse statements which convey the same information. Each statement must be stand-alone, containing all necessary information.
- A statement is made of `context`+`answer_core`.
- Generate an answer_core and 15 contexts.
- For each of the contexts, `context`+`answer_core` must form a valid sentence. Context should not include the answer_core.
- In contexts never use the same wording twice - diversity is key.
- Be simple and concise, but keep all necessary information from the question given.
- It should be very obvious that the `answer_core` must come right after the `context`, with no ambiguity. Someone who knows the answer to the question, should be able to continue the context with exactly the `answer_core`, so `context` must perfectly determine the `answer_core`.
- The answer_core must be truly minimal. For example if given the answer "Treatment with sodium hypochlorite", the answer_core must be just "sodium hypochlorite". It should be a standalone noun atomic phrase. Any non-core words must be placed in contexts.
- The answer_core can be AT MOST 4 WORDS, ideally less.
