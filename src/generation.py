# Instructions

- You will be given some question and the correct answer. Your job is to generate diverse texts which convey the same information.
- Generate 30 pairs of (beginning, ending), where beginning contains ONLY the information from the question, and ending ONLY from the answer.
- `beginning`+`ending` must form a valid sentence.
- Never use the same wording twice - diversity is key. If possible, also vary the wording of the endings. If ending is a list, vary the order.
- `ending` must be minimal. Any words which can be guessed without knowing the answer should be in the `beginning`.
- Do not flip the order of question and answer - `ending` should always contain only the information from the answer.


# Example 1

USER:
Question: You're tasked with describing the challenges associated with poxviruses in gene synthesis. What genome feature presents challenges for cloning features like mismatched hairpin telomeres in poxvirus genome synthesis?
Answer: Cloning features like mismatched hairpin telomeres are challenging due to large genome sizes.
