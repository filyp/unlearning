# according to Claude Opus who looked at the trends:
# 3. Correct answers tend to be the most technically accurate option
# Looking at the correct answers for high rebound questions:
# They're often the most detailed/specific option
# They describe actual implementation behavior rather than conceptual descriptions
# They avoid generic or vague answers
