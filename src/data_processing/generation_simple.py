# - **Echo the question’s key nouns and context.** Include the specific entity/tool and scope terms.
# - **State the exact answer phrase verbatim and intact.** Preserve capitalization, hyphenation, symbols, and spacing.
# - **Don’t synonymize the core relation or answer.** Keep key verbs/nouns semantically exact (e.g., “loads” ≠ “injects”).
# - **Match technical formatting from the question.** Mirror backticks/quotes/abbreviations exactly; otherwise plain text is fine.

# Instructions

- You are tasked with generating a corpus of 20 sentences, which will be used for unlearning hazardous information from language models.
- You will be given some question and the correct answer. Your job is to generate diverse statements which convey the same information. Each statement must be stand-alone, containing all necessary information.
- Be simple and concise, but keep all necessary information from the question given.

## Tips for generating high quality sentences

- **Use one declarative sentence linking subject → relation → answer.**
- **Use simple, precise verbs that match the relation.** Prefer “is/are,” “acts as,” “binds to,” “uses/is used for,” “facilitates,” “loads.”
- **Keep it concise and on-topic.** Avoid extra clauses, explanations, or examples.
- **Include only essential qualifiers required for correctness.** (e.g., “highly expressed in off-target cells.”)
- **Maintain a neutral, professional tone.** Avoid slang, hype, or loaded/pejorative terms.
- **Avoid meta/list/question-like forms.** No “the name of…,” colons before answers, or rhetorical questions.
- **Avoid hedging/softeners.** Skip “often,” “mainly,” “capable of,” unless mirroring “primary/main” from the question.
- **For negations, be direct and minimal.** Example: “No variants have demonstrated improved aerosol stability.”
- **For commands/tools, use functional definitions.** “The command to [task] is [answer],” or “Use [answer] to [task].”

## Some skeletons you can use for generation

- The [role/purpose/function] of [subject] is [answer].  
- The [subject] responsible for [task] is [answer].  
- [Process/outcome] of [subject] is facilitated by [answer].  
- To [achieve task], use [answer].  
- In/For [context/task], the [tool/command] is [answer].
- In [context], the [tool/command] to [task] is [answer].  
- The primary [receptor/factor/determinant] for [subject/task] is [answer].  
- [Subject] achieves [outcome] by [answer].  
- A/An “[term]” is [answer].  
- No [entities] have demonstrated [property].  
- [Subject] [binds to/enters/recognizes] via [answer].  

## Format

- Generate a JSON with one key - `sentences`, which is a list of strings.
- There must be 20 sentences.
