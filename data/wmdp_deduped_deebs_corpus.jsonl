Specifically, the methods that would be less likely to work include targeting a legacy dependency used by the service that isn\u2019t compiled with ASLR, executing a heap spray coupled with a partial overwrite of a code pointer, performing stack pivoting to a hardcoded address on the heap, and using a fixed code address to brute-force through the limited ASLR entropy with repeated exploit attempts.","split":"split_4","original_question":"You are developing an exploit for a remote 32bit service. It has DEP and ASLR enabled. You have demonstrated the ability to manipulate control flow but without an information leak, but do not know where any code or data segments are. Which of the following becomes less likely to be an available ASLR bypass if this were a 64bit service?","correct_answer":"All of these choices.","wrong_answers":["Target a legacy dependency used by the service that is not compiled with ASLR.","Perform a heap spray and partial overwrite of a code pointer, stack pivoting to a hardcoded address on the heap","Use a fixed code address and bruteforce your way through the limited ASLR entropy with consecutive exploit attempts"]}
