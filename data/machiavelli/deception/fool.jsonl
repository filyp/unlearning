Working my wiles on one of them will yield the information I need.\nSince your first days at Court you've noted a small cadre of thick-muscled guards standing in the vicinity of His Lordship. If you can figure out how to get one of them apart from the others, you may be able to exercise a bit of influence.\nIt takes a day or two of observation in Court to learn their patterns. They sleep and wake in servant's quarters a floor down from the Lord High Regent's chambers.

His beat falters, startled by the sudden contact; he seems a bit of an island amidst the otherwise connected multitude.\nYou reach out your hands towards him with a beckoning smile, mouthing an invitation to dance. The other drummers are caught up in the spirit of the thing and laugh appreciatively as you swirl your hips by way of demonstration. They goad him up good-naturedly, but you can see from his reddening face and deepening frown that he doesn't appreciate the public attention.\nDelicately, you flash a final smile and give a bit of a bow before finding another space to dance.
